### Introduction

Welcome to Gent's Integrated Rimworld Archive Network. Currently we are implementing the UI.

"I-RAN" can mean anything, depending on your mood.
 * random four-letter combination that is pronounceable and not used by any tool I'm aware of.
 * a combination of the two words "I" (the prounoun used to refer to yourself) and "RAN" (the past tense of "Run")
 * "Integrated Rimworld Archive Network" - you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
 * "I RAN FOR A WHILE BUT THEN DECIDED TO BE AN ASSHOLE" - when it breaks
