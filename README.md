### Introduction

Welcome to Gent's Integrated Rimworld Archive Network. Currently we are implementing the UI.

"I-RAN" can mean anything, depending on your mood.
 * random four-letter combination that is pronounceable and not used by any tool I'm aware of.
 * a combination of the two words "I" (the prounoun used to refer to yourself) and "RAN" (the past tense of "Run")
 * "Integrated Rimworld Archive Network" - you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
 * "I RAN FOR A WHILE BUT THEN DECIDED TO BE AN ASSHOLE" - when it breaks
 
---------------------
 
## Required Setup

---------------------
MainFolder
 * I-RAN - Controler.exe
 * I-RAN - Model.dll
 * I-RAN - View.dll
 * RW-Install
   * RW install from under 'RW-Install\'
 * GitPortable
   * Git install from under 'Git\PortableGit_WIN32'
   
Use 'SetupInstall.bat' to move the RW-Install and Git\PortableGit_WIN32 for you.
Remember to drag your own copy of RW into 'RW-Install'. Insure the Mods folder exists but is empty!

## Not Uploading .sdf File

---------------------

The .sdf file is a file generated by VS Intillisense. PLEASE do not upload it. Its HUGE!

Instead do the following:
1- Go to "Tools -> Options -> Text Editor -> C/C++ -> Advanced"
2- Scroll to "Fallback Location"
3- Set "Always Use Fallback Location" and "Do Not Warn If Fallback Location Used" to True
4- Set "Fallback Location" to something like "%temp%"
